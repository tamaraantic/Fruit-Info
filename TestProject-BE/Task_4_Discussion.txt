Ideas for code integration on Git:
* Using branching strategy:
    Branching strategy enables organized parallel development, prevents conflicts between changes,
    and facilitates management of the development workflow.
* Code Reviews:
    They provide additional security and code quality through feedback from peers, helping to identify errors,
    improve code quality, and ensure consistency in development.
* Git Hooks:
    They automate various operations such as code checking, running tests, or sending notifications,
    improving efficiency and consistency in the development process.

Continuous Integration (CI):
* Automate tests:
    Integrate automated unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests
    into the CI pipeline to validate code changes automatically.
* Enable code quality checks:
    Configure static code analysis tools (e.g., SonarQube) to analyze code quality metrics
    and enforce coding standards as part of the CI process.

Continuous Delivery (CD):
* Implement small releases to gradually introduce new features or updates
    to a subset of users before deploying to the entire user base.
